-- 2026-06-18 night: get_converted_members must return source_category from
-- trial_signups so the Members card can correctly label walk-ins ("in_person",
-- "mb_direct", "walk_in") instead of falling through to "Website" whenever
-- utm_source is null.
--
-- Eliyani Jimenez (Astoria 6/19) signed up in person but the dashboard
-- labeled her Source as "Website" because her utm_source was null and the
-- frontend default for null utm_source is "Website". Truth: source_category
-- = 'in_person'.
